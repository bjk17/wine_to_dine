## What does the code do?

It uses [fuzzy string matching](https://chairnerd.seatgeek.com/fuzzywuzzy-fuzzy-string-matching-in-python/)[1]
to assign[2] every red wine from SB's inventory a score from GWS's database[3] and prints out the
score, price, size of bottle, names, URLs and match certainty for all items fulfilling the criteria
 - having a minimum GWS score of 92% and
 - costing no more than SEK 999 

_[1] The fuzzy matching is needed because the wines are registered differently between the sites_

_[2] For performance it pre-filters based on country and vintage (assumes correct registration)_

_[3] Currently only the top 10k scores (out of ~26.5k) are downloaded_

### Caching

All API responses (JSON data) are cached in the `wine_to_dine/cache` folder and are used in
consecutive runs of the program as long as the cache file exists on the disk. This is done partly
because GWS's API has some rate limiting (up to 10 requests per minute) but this also helped when
developing the code. 

To keep it simple stupid there is no cache invalidation logic in the code. Instead the user needs
to clear the cache manually as they see fit. The methods `Systembolaget.clear_cache()` and 
`GlobalWineScore.clear_cache()` were implemented and intentionally left for future development.

## Interesting next steps

The project is currently in a usable state for me personally, but as time and interest allows I'd
like to look at implementing the following features:

 - [ ] Filter recommendations on store availability
 - [ ] Make available as an interactive Telegram bot 
     + e.g., a `/recommend_red_wine` command that takes arguments such as store availability, 
     minimum score and price range
